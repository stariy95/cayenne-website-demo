sites that use Cayenne. If you want to add your Cayenne site to this page,

### AccessPoint Inc. (<http://www.accesspointinc.com/>)

A story submitted by Bret Gregory: "I work for AccessPoint Inc., a
privately-held CLEC offering integrated communications services to small-
and medium-sized businesses. We use Cayenne for our internal accounting and
reconciliation application. This application allows us to recognize
uncaptured revenue streams as well as accounting margins and billing
errors. In addition, Cayenne is used in our internal reporting application.
These applications and thus Cayenne are central to the financial health of
the company."

### Global Legal Information Network (GLIN) (<http://www.glin.gov/>)

GLIN is a legal repository for the Law Library of Congress. It has been
around for 30 years, and in digital form since the early 90s. However, it
was only partially publicly available before February 2005 when a
Cayenne-based system was launched. The system has roughly 200,000 records,
spanning 200 gb of fulltext data and 15 gb of associated metadata. It
represents the world's largest publicly available legal index, spanning 10
languages and 35 jurisdictions. The system is accessible in 4 languages
currently and will support 14 languages in the nearest future, thus
becoming the most internationalized site in the federal government, after
the IRS.

### ish onCourse (<http://www.ish.com.au/oncourse>)

A story submitted by Aristedes Maniatis, ish owner: "Written for the
education sector, ish onCourse is a student and enrolment tracking system
with a strong marketing focus. It uses Cayenne's client/server three tier
setup, has a cross platform Swing GUI, an embedded Derby database and Jetty
for servlets. Cayenne has allowed us to create a clear user interface with
real time data validation, replication to a web site and the use of caching
and paging in Cayenne for the application to work well across slow WAN
links."

<a name="Successstories-NationalHockeyLeague(http://www.nhl.com/)"></a>
### National Hockey League (<http://www.nhl.com/>)

NHL was one of the first large-scale Cayenne deployments. After the initial
trial of Cayenne in 2002, NHL switched all their web applications to
Cayenne. NHL.com and individual hockey team sites are receiving tens of
millions of hits a day, and are relying on Cayenne for all database access.
The applications are often upgraded with the bleeding edge builds from
Cayenne trunk to take advantage of the latest framework features.
