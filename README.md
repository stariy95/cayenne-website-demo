# Demo site using Hugo 

Hugo site with some content from *new* version of http://cayenne.apache.org.
This code is just for experiments.

## How To Run

### Dev mode

Just clone and run maven, nothing else required.

    git clone https://github.com/stariy95/cayenne-website-demo.git
    cd cayenne-website-demo
    mvn

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. In dev mode site supports live-reloading.

:grey_exclamation: _You can change host and port by setting `dev.host` and `dev.port` properties:_
   
    mvn -Ddev.host="my.local" -Ddev.port="8080"

### Publish

To publish new version just run Maven with `publish` profile. This will build production version of the site (with cayenne.apache.org base URL) and push commit into `asf-site` branch that will be synced with actual site content location:
    
    mvn -Ppublish -Dmsg="commit message describing site changes"
    
That's all, so be carefull and review your changes before publishing (also don't forget to check them after).

Don't forget to push you source's changes so others won't rewrite them.
    
:grey_exclamation: apache `gitpubsub` should be setup in order actual content sync to happen. 

*NOTE*: This process can be automated by Jenkins. It can run publish on every commit to `master`. But at first it is better to use manual publishing.

## CMS guide

### Content modifications

#### Publishing news

To publish news simply add new file at `src/main/site/content/news/` folder.
You can use following template: 

`some-good-news.md`

    ---
    title: Good news everyone!
    date: 2017-01-01T00:00:00+03:00
    --- 
    
    Content goes here


#### Releasing new cayenne version

To update site content with information about new Cayenne version you need to perform these steps:

* Update data in `src/main/site/data/cayenne.yaml` file.
* Wright news (see information above).
* Update documentation, this can be done with `build-docs.sh` script. 
  You can run it like this: `./build-docs.sh 4.1.M2` 

### Advanced 

Node.js, Yarn, Gulp and Hugo used to build this site, Maven used just to boostrap Node.js and Yarn tools and launch Gulp tasks.
Hugo binaries managed by [hugo-bin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hugo-bin) NPM module.

#### Src structure

There is two main parts of site src:
* `src/main/assets` assets processed by [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) tasks

    * `/gulp/` - list of Gulp tasks
    
        Important tasks:
        * `hugo.js` - contains tasks that launch Hugo to process all content
        * `images.js` - compress and copy images
        * `reference.js` - replace references to generated resources inside content
        * `revision.js` - generate manifest file with resources versions
        * `scripts.js` - launch Webpack to process JavaScript resources
        * `serve.js` - launch dev-version of site with live-reloading
        * `styles.js` - generate CSS bundle (concat, minify, etc..)
    * `/images/` - images that will be compressed and published into site `/img` directory, 
    you can put any stuff used by site here (see `/gulp/images.js`)
    * `/scripts/` - JavaScript sources, `main.js` is an entry point for the final bundle,
    will be processed by Webpack (see `/gulp/scripts.js`)
    * `/styles/` - Sass sources, `main.scss` is an entry point for the final bundle
    (see `/gulp/styles.js`)
    * `gulpfile.js` - main file for Gulp tasks, define some global path constants
    * `package.json` - all project dependencies are defined here

* `src/main/site` assets processed [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site generator

    * `/content/` - main content part of the site, markdown and HTML files
    * `/data/` - data files in *yaml* format
    * `/layouts/` - site templates, using [GO templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/)
    * `/static/` - files that will be copied as is to the final site content, note that `js`, `img` and `css` directories
    are processed via Gulp tasks, and shouldn't be used directly, instead use coresponding directories in `assets`.     
    * `config.yaml` - Hugo configuration


## ToDo

* Add fontawesome as dependency
* Dockbook ToC into docs aside
* $small-font-size-rem - https://davidwalsh.name/rem-px-browser-function-sass
