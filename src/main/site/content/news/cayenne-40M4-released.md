--- 

Apache Cayenne team is glad to announce the latest milestone of Cayenne - 4.0.M. The new release features a number of important things:

* Stabilizes database reverse-engineering tools for DB-first ORM flow.
* Plugs holes and omissions in the fluent query API.
* Expands encryption capabilities to all data types.
* Improves transaction management API.
* Provides alternative binary protocols for ROP, greatly improving its performance. 
* Includes a new Modeler welcome screen.
* Fixes numerous bugs, updates docs, etc., etc. 

Cayenne can be downloaded from [here](/download.html). Make sure to consult [UPGRADE.txt](https://github.com/apache/cayenne/blob/4.0.M4/docs/doc/src/main/resources/UPGRADE.txt) file before updating.

Before we start discussing individual features, a few words on the future development effort. Cayenne 4.0 is quickly approaching "beta" status. There's a good chance that the following release will be feature-complete and we will enter "beta" and associated code freeze of the runtime framework. 

Now the new things in a bit more detail:

### Fluent query API
These fluent queries are new in M4:

*SQLExec*

    // insert
    int inserted = SQLExec.query("INSERT INTO ARTIST (ARTIST_ID, ARTIST_NAME) " + 
      "VALUES (#bind($id), #bind($name))")
      .paramsArray(55, "a3")
      .update(context);
    
    // update
    int updated = SQLExec
      .query("UPDATE ARTIST SET ARTIST_NAME = 'b3' WHERE ARTIST_NAME = 'a3'")
      .update(context);

*MappedSelect*

    List<Artist> artists = MappedSelect.query("SelectArtists", Artist.class)
      .param("name", "artist1")
      .select(context);

*MappedExec*

    int[] updated = MappedExec.query("UpdateArtists").param("name", "artist2").update(context);

*ProcedureCall*

    // select
    List<Artist> artists = ProcedureCall.query("select_sp", Artist.class)
                    .param("name", "Artist")
                    .param("paintingPrice", 3000)
                    .limit(2).select(context);
    
    // update
    int updated = ProcedureCall.query("update_sp")
                    .param("paintingPrice", 3000).update(context);
    
    // call and get out parameters
    int outParam = ProcedureCall.query("out_sp")
                    .param("name", "Artist")
                    .call(context).getOutParam("artist_out");

### Reverse Engineering Improvements

There are a lot of improvements and bug fixes covering reverse engineering functionality (aka "DB-first flow"). There's still more work to do to make it perfect, but the API is starting to stabilize and the tools have already become very usable (as in actually used in production on many projects). Follow this [link](/docs/4.0/cayenne-guide/cayenne-guide-part4.html) to learn what DB-First flow is all about and how to use it.

### Cayenne Crypto Improvements

We've aded support for mapping encrypted columns to numbers, Strings, etc.

### Transaction control

Added TransactionListener to allow for better control of manual transactions. 

### ROP Improvements
With M4 it's much easier to plug external tools for ROP connectivity and serialization purposes. Jetty HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 Client and Protostuff have been already added to the Cayenne and are supported out of the box.
