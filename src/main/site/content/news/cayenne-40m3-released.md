This new milestone release has plenty of new features, bug fixes and other improvements. Below are just the main highlights. For more details check out the full release notes further down, as well as [UPGRADE.txt](https://github.com/apache/cayenne/blob/4.0.M3/docs/doc/src/main/resources/UPGRADE.txt).

Cayenne can be downloaded from [here](/download.html).

### Java 7

Since this milestone minimal Java version is 1.7. If you still need Java 1.6, you can use Cayenne 3.1 or 4.0.M2 until your application is able to upgrade.

### Java 8 Date/Time and Joda-Time Support

Cayenne now has two additional modules that contain ExtendedTypes for Java 8 Date/Time and Joda-Time support. You will need to add appropriate dependency and then create a coresponding module and add it to the ServerRuntime. For example:

    Module java8Module = new CayenneJava8Module();
    this.runtime = new ServerRuntime("cayenne-project.xml", java8Module);

### Improvements in Query API

All new fluent query classes (ObjectSelect, SQLSelect, SelectById) have the following new methods:

* `List<T> select(ObjectContext context);`
* `T selectOne(ObjectContext context);`
* `T selectFirst(ObjectContext context);`
* `void iterate(ObjectContext context, ResultIteratorCallback<T> callback);`
* `ResultIterator<T> iterator(ObjectContext context);`
* `ResultBatchIterator<T> batchIterator(ObjectContext context, int size);`

The "old" style SelectQuery is still supported and also includes these methods. 

Also ResultIterator and ResultBatchIterator are both AutoCloseable now. So you will be able to use try-with-resources with them.

### Non-blocking DataSource

Default Cayenne DataSource provider is switched to a non-blocking implementation that has a much better concurrency compared to the old version.

### DBCP2

DBCPDataSourceFactory is now based on DBCP2 (which is required under Java 1.7 and newer). If you are using it, you will need to take a few steps to upgrade. For more details see [UPGRADE.txt](https://github.com/apache/cayenne/blob/4.0.M3/docs/doc/src/main/resources/UPGRADE.txt).

### Capturing a stream of commit changes

Sometimes it is very useful to capture all or parts of "commit log" for commits made through Cayenne (for audit purposes, etc). It has always been a challenge to do it in a consistent and convenient manner. We've made a few attempts to solve this before. M3 features new and the most comprehensive solution. There is a [PostCommitBuilder](https://github.com/apache/cayenne/blob/4.0.M3/cayenne-lifecycle/src/main/java/org/apache/cayenne/lifecycle/postcommit/PostCommitModuleBuilder.java) class that helps to create a special DI module with all required extensions for this to work. It allows to register [PostCommitListeners](https://github.com/apache/cayenne/blob/4.0.M3/cayenne-lifecycle/src/main/java/org/apache/cayenne/lifecycle/postcommit/PostCommitListener.java) that will receive an event on every commit, containing a full commit log object.
