Title: Cayenne 4.0 Beta 1 Released
date: 2017-06-12T17:38:42+03:00

--- 

Apache Cayenne team is glad to announce a beta release of Cayenne 4.0. What this means for our users is
that now the API is frozen and it is safe to try it out even if you are not usually confortable living 
on the bleeding edge of unstable releases. We'd like to hear from you about your upgrade experiences. 
And of course we'll strive to fix any remaining bugs before 4.0 goes final. To give you more confidence, 
we'd like to mention that most of the Cayenne developers have been using 4.0 in production for years. 

From now on the 4.0 branch will concentrate on bug fixes, Modeler improvements, documentation, web site
and other such things.

We are planning to publish a more detailed 4.0 comparision with 3.1 shortly. For now let's take a look at
things that have changed since the late milestone - M5:

* A native **Gradle Plugin**.
* Fresh **Modeler design** (along with many small UI improvements and bug fixes).
* A switch from _commons-logging_ to **_SLF4J_** API
* Optional **HMAC** in crypto module
* Numerous bug fixes, updated docs, etc. 

Cayenne can be downloaded from [here]({{< ref "about/download.md" >}}). Make sure to consult [UPGRADE.txt](https://github.com/apache/cayenne/blob/4.0.B1/docs/doc/src/main/resources/UPGRADE.txt) file before updating.

BTW, here is an example of the Gradle plugin use :

    buildscript {
        repositories {
            mavenCentral()
        }
        dependencies {
            classpath group: 'org.apache.cayenne.plugins', name: 'cayenne-gradle-plugin', version: '4.0.B1'
        }
    }
    
    apply plugin: 'org.apache.cayenne'

    cayenne.defaultDataMap 'datamap.map.xml'
    
    dependencies {
        compile cayenne.dependency('server')
        compile cayenne.dependency('java8')
    }
