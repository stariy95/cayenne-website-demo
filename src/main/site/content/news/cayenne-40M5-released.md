--- 

Apache Cayenne team is glad to announce the latest milestone of Cayenne - 4.0.M5. 
The new release features a number of important things:

* New fluent API for SQL functions (including long-awaited **aggregate** functions).
* Auto-loading of additional Cayenne modules.
* New JCache module that allows to easily include any compatible cache provider.
* Further improvements and stabilization of database reverse-engineering tools.
* Fixes bugs, updates docs, etc. 

Cayenne can be downloaded from [here](/download.html). Make sure to consult [UPGRADE.txt](https://github.com/apache/cayenne/blob/4.0.M5/docs/doc/src/main/resources/UPGRADE.txt) file before updating.

Before we start discussing individual features, a few words on the future development effort. 
Cayenne 4.0 is quickly approaching "beta" status. There's a good chance that the following release will be 
feature-complete and we will enter "beta" and associated code freeze of the runtime framework. 

Now the new things in a bit more detail:

### Fluent query API
These great additions to Fluent API are new in M5:

*ColumnSelect*

    List<String> names = ObjectSelect.query(Artist.class)
                         .column(Artist.ARTIST_NAME).select(context);

*Aggregate Functions*

    // easy way to select count
    long count = ObjectSelect.query(Artist.class).selectCount(context);
    
*GROUP BY .. HAVING*

    Property<Double> minPrice = Artist.PAINTING_ARRAY.dot(Painting.ESTIMATED_PRICE).min();
    
    // Object[0] is a name (String)
    // Object[1] is a price (Double)
    // GROUP BY clause is generated automatically based on the query semantics
    List<Object[]> nameAndMinPrice = ObjectSelect.query(Artist.class)
    				    .columns(Artist.ARTIST_NAME, minPrice)
    				    .having(minPrice.gt(2000.0))
    				    .select(context);
    				
*SQL Functions*
    
    Property<Integer> nameLength = Artist.ARTIST_NAME.length();
    List<Artist> artists = ObjectSelect.query(Artist.class, nameLength.gt(5))
                            .select(context);
    

### Reverse Engineering Improvements

We pushed DB reverse engineering functionality further. This time in addition to clearing bugs and perform smoother importing
we changed cdbimport plugin configuration to make it clearer and ready for future improvements we have in mind.

The plugin itself has changed it's name to *"cayenne-maven-plugin"*, so now you can use short commands like the following:
    
    mvn cayenne:cdbimport

**_Important note_**: please refer to [UPGRADE.txt](https://github.com/apache/cayenne/blob/4.0.M5/docs/doc/src/main/resources/UPGRADE.txt) for detailed changes in _cdbimport_ configuration.
