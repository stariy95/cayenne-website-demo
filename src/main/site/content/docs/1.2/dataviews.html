Unless we find volunteers, this package won't be supported very well.</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<P>Cayenne takes care of managing persistence layer for all types of applications - web, rich client, command line, etc. With DataViews Cayenne extends into the area of integrating such persistent layer with Swing GUI.</P>

<P>DataViews define various presentation parameters of the DataObjects in an XML format. Just like DataMaps are edited using CayenneModeler, DataViews are edited with <A href="dvmodeler-gui-tool.html" title="DVModeler GUI Tool">DVModeler GUI Tool</A>. Runtime DataView classes are a part of the main Cayenne JAR file.</P>

<P>For manual editing of the DataViews, DataView DTD is included in the distribution. It is pretty small and the names are self-explanatory once you become familiar with the Data View structure described in this chapter.</P>
