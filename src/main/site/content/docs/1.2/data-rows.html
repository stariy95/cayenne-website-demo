<P>DataObjects creation and registering with DataContext is an expensive operation. There are cases when only a few objects are really used, but the application still has to fetch a lot of objects. For instance when a user performs a search, result may contain thousands of records, but user will only check 2-3 of them. Cayenne allows programmers to explicitly disable objects creation for such cases. Results will be returned in the form of java.util.Map's. In Cayenne such maps are called <TT>DataRows</TT>.</P>

<P>Benefits of Data Rows:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Fetch speed increase. Our tests show 2x to 5x performance increase.</LI>
	<LI>Using regular Cayenne query API.</LI>
	<LI>Using same DataMaps.</LI>
	<LI>Easy to convert to DataObjects.</LI>
</UL>


<P>Data rows don't have all the object-oriented features of DataObjects. In particular, data rows don't support relationships. It is easy to create a DataObject from a row though. See examples below.</P>

<P>Data rows example:</P>

<DIV class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><DIV class="codeContent panelContent">
