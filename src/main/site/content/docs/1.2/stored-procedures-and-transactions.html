There maybe a situations when stored procedures handle their own transactions and an application is configured to use Cayenne-managed transactions. This is obviously conflicting and undesirable behavior. In this case ProcedureQueries should be executed explicitly wrapped in an &quot;external&quot; Transaction. This is one of the few cases when a user should worry about transactions at all.
