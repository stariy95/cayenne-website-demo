Each DataDomain can be configured to enable or disable DataObject pre-commit validation by (un)checking &quot;Child DataContexts Validate Objects&quot; checkbox. By default validation is enabled for all newly created DataDomains. More information on DataObject validation is provided in the <A href="dataobject-validation.html" title="DataObject Validation">user guide</A>.</P>
