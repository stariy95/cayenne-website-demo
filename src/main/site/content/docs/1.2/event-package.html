<P>Cayenne includes a full-featured events mechanism. It allows creation of local and distributed event queues. It is very powerful and generic; it is not tied to Cayenne persistence features in any way and can be used in any application. The most important features are:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Event senders do not have to deal with event dispatching details - listener handling and dispatches are done via instances of EventManager.</LI>
	<LI>Any types of listeners can be registered. Listeners do not have to implement a specific interface.</LI>
	<LI>No explicit unregistering of listeners is required. Listeners are cleaned up when they go out of scope, or when the event subject goes out of scope.</LI>
	<LI>Supports local and remote dispatches. Remote dispatches can be done via arbitrary transport by implementing transport-specific EventBridge. There are two existing EventBridge implementations - using JMS and using JavaGroups.</LI>
	<LI>Dispatches can be done both synchronously (sender waits till all listeners finish) or asyncronously (sender posts an event to the queue, and returns without waiting for the processing to complete).</LI>
	<LI>In a similar manner individual listeners can register as blocking or non-blocking.</LI>
</UL>

This may result in a premature cleanup of a given subject, and automatic unregistering of all listeners. Good practice is to make subject a &quot;public static final&quot; variable of the event sender class if a subject is common for all instances of senders; or make it an ivar of a sender instance if subject is only related to this instance.</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>
