<UL>
	<LI><B>JDK:</B> Cayenne, including GUI tools, is written in 100% Java, and runs on any Java-compatible platform. Required JDK version is 1.5 or higher. <EM>(The last version of Cayenne compatible with JDK 1.4 is 1.2.x/2.0.x; JDK 1.3 - 1.1.x)</EM></LI>
</UL>


<UL>
	<LI><B>JDBC Driver:</B> You will need a JDBC driver to access the database. Information about various drivers and database-specific configuration is provided on the <A href="http://cayenne.apache.org/docs/3.0/database-support.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Database Support</A> page.</LI>
</UL>


<UL>
	<LI><B>Third-party Libraries:</B> Depending on the application nature, Cayenne may optionally require a few third-party open source packages. See <A href="jar-files-and-dependencies.html" title="JAR Files and Dependencies">JAR Files and Dependencies</A> page for details.</LI>
</UL>



<H3><A name="Installation-ObtainingCayenne"></A>Obtaining Cayenne</H3>

<P>Installing Cayenne is simple - just download and unpack the distribution. Download page is located here: <A href="http://cayenne.apache.org/download.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://cayenne.apache.org/download.html</A>. Select a distribution for your development platform (cross-platform version, as the name implies, works on any OS that has Java).</P>

<P>Once you've done that, you can <A href="running-cayennemodeler.html" title="Running CayenneModeler">start the Modeler</A> and use appropriate jar files in your application. See <A href="jar-files-and-dependencies.html" title="JAR Files and Dependencies">JAR Files and Dependencies</A> for more information. </P>

<P>If you are using Maven2, the runtime dependencies can be obtained in a standard Maven way (i.e. <A href="cayenne-and-maven.html" title="Cayenne and Maven">by declaring them in the POM</A>), still you likely want to download the distribution, as it includes the Modeler.</P>
