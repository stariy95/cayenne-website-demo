<P>This is a step-by-step tutorial showing how to write a database application with Cayenne. When you are done with it, you should have an understanding of the basics of object-relational mapping using CayenneModeler and how to use the Cayenne framework in standalone (command-line or otherwise) and web applications. The tutorial uses Maven, Eclipse IDE and Derby database, however it can be easily recreated with another combination of a database, an IDE and a build system. Full tutorial source code in a form of Eclipse project is distributed with Cayenne (see <TT>&quot;tutorials/tutorial&quot;</TT> folder).</P>

Not everybody is familiar with Maven, and not everybody likes it. However we decided that the benefits of the setup simplicity outweigh any downsides. Note that the tutorial is using <TT>m2eclipse</TT> plugin and doesn't even require a command-line Maven installation. Moreover most of the useful Cayenne Maven hackery is presented in boxed inserts throughout the text, while a Maven-agnostic alternative is shown in the main text.</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>
