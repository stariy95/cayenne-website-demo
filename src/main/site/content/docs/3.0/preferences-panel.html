<P>CayenneModeler relies on a number of user-specific preferences to operate in a user-friendly manner. Some preferences are determined automatically behind the scenes (such as preferred window size or last visited directory), some can be configured by users via &quot;Preferences Panel&quot; described in this chapter.</P>

<P>Preferences are saved and retrieved using Cayenne on top of embedded HSQL database. The actual preferences data is stored as a set of SQL commands in a flat file under <A href="cayenne-user-directory.html" title="Cayenne User Directory">Cayenne user directory</A>. </P>

<P>To display Preferences Panel, select &quot;Tools &gt; Preferences&quot; from the menu:</P>

<P>A dialog window opens. To navigate to a specific type of preferences, select an item from the list on the left. When &quot;Save&quot; button is clicked, preference selections are permanently stored in the preferences database and will not be lost when Modeler is restarted.</P>
