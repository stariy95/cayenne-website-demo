<P>Local DataSource panel allows to configure a number of named DataSources that can be used for local database access from the Modeler, or to speed up creation of new DataNodes. Also since local DataSources can be associated with any DataNodes, regardless of the actual information configured for a given DataNode, it makes them extremely useful to separate your local connection information from the one in the deployment environment. For example a JNDI DataNode can be used for the database access from the Modeler in the absence of JNDI container.</P>
