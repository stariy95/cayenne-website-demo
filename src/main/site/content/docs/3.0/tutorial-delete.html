	<P>This section explains how to model relationship delete rules and how to delete individual objects as well as sets of objects. Also demonstrated the use of <TT>DataObjectUtils</TT> class to run a query.</P>

<H3><A name="TutorialDelete-SettingUpDeleteRules"></A>Setting Up Delete Rules</H3>

<P>Before we discuss the API for object deletion, lets go back to CayenneModeler and set up some <A href="delete-rules.html" title="Delete Rules">delete rules</A>. Doing this is optional but will simplify correct handling of the objects related to deleted objects.</P>

<P>In the Modeler go to &quot;Artist&quot; ObjEntity, &quot;Relationships&quot; tab and select &quot;Cascade&quot; for the &quot;paintings&quot; relationship delete rule:</P>

<P><SPAN class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="/docs/3.0/images/modeler-deleterule.png" style="border: 0px solid black"></SPAN></P>

<P>Repeat this step for other relationships:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>For Gallery set &quot;paintings&quot; relationship to be &quot;Nullify&quot;, as a painting can exist without being displayed in a gallery.</LI>
	<LI>For Painting et both relationships rules to &quot;Nullify&quot;.</LI>
</UL>


<P>Now save the mapping, and refresh the project in Eclispe.</P>

<H3><A name="TutorialDelete-DeletingObjects"></A>Deleting Objects</H3>

<P>While deleting objects is possible via SQL, qualifying a delete on one or more IDs, a more common way in Cayenne (or ORM in general) is to get a hold of the object first, and then delete it via the context. Let's use utility class DataObjectUtils to find an artist:</P>

<DIV class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><DIV class="codeContent panelContent">
<PRE class="code-java">Expression qualifier = ExpressionFactory.matchExp(Artist.NAME_PROPERTY, <SPAN class="code-quote">&quot;Pablo Picasso&quot;</SPAN>);
SelectQuery select = <SPAN class="code-keyword">new</SPAN> SelectQuery(Artist.class, qualifier);
Artist picasso = (Artist) DataObjectUtils.objectForQuery(context, select);</PRE>
</DIV></DIV>

<P>Now let's delete the artist:</P>
<DIV class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><DIV class="codeContent panelContent">
<PRE class="code-java"><SPAN class="code-keyword">if</SPAN> (picasso != <SPAN class="code-keyword">null</SPAN>) {
    context.deleteObject(picasso);
    context.commitChanges();
}</PRE>
</DIV></DIV>

<P>Since we set up &quot;Cascade&quot; delete rule for the Artist.paintings relationships, Cayenne will automatically delete all paintings of this artist. So when your run the app you'll see this output:</P>

<DIV class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><DIV class="preformattedContent panelContent">
<PRE>INFO: SELECT t0.DATE_OF_BIRTH, t0.ID, t0.NAME FROM ARTIST t0 WHERE t0.NAME = ? 
 [bind: 1-&gt;NAME:'Pablo Picasso']
INFO: === returned 1 row. - took 5 ms.
INFO: +++ transaction committed.
INFO: --- will run 2 queries.
INFO: --- transaction started.
INFO: DELETE FROM PAINTING WHERE ID = ?
INFO: [batch bind: 1-&gt;ID:2]
INFO: [batch bind: 1-&gt;ID:1]
INFO: === updated 2 rows.
INFO: DELETE FROM ARTIST WHERE ID = ?
INFO: [batch bind: 1-&gt;ID:1]
INFO: === updated 1 row.
INFO: +++ transaction committed.
</PRE>
</DIV></DIV>
