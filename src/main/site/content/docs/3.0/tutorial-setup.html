	<P>The goal of this section of the tutorial is to install (or check that you already have installed) a minimally needed set of software to build a Cayenne application.</P>

<H3><A name="TutorialSetup-InstallJava"></A>Install Java</H3>

<P>Obviously, JDK has to be installed. Cayenne 3.0 requires JDK 1.5 or newer.</P>

<H3><A name="TutorialSetup-InstallEclipseIDEandtheMavenPlugin"></A>Install Eclipse IDE and the Maven Plugin</H3>

<P>Download Eclipse <A href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">from here</A>. This tutorial is based on the Galileo package (Eclipse 3.5), JEE edition, still it should work with any recent vanilla Eclipse distribution.</P>

<P>After downloading Eclipse, unpack it somewhere in the filesystem, and start it. The only plugin that you need for the tutorial is <A href="http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">m2eclipse</A>. To install it, in Eclipse go to &quot;Help &gt; Install New Software&quot;, then click on &quot;Add..&quot; to add a new download site, and enter &quot;Maven&quot; in the &quot;Name&quot; field, and &quot;http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e&quot; in the &quot;Location&quot; field. You may install any of the optional components that you think you need, but for this tutorial we only select a few basic components as shown on the following screenshot:</P>

<P>From here follow the Eclipse dialog instructions to finish the installation.</P>
