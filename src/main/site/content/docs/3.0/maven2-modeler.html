	<P><TT>modeler</TT> is an Maven 2 mojo that runs the latest version of Cayenne Modeler.  It saves you from having to download the modeler and installing it manually, which is really nice if you're following the latest changes in the snapshot builds.</P>

<P>There is no configuration of this plugin, but you do need to add to add the plugin to your POM:</P>

<DIV class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><DIV class="codeContent panelContent">
<PRE class="code-xml">
<SPAN class="code-tag">&lt;build&gt;</SPAN>
    <SPAN class="code-tag">&lt;plugins&gt;</SPAN>
        <SPAN class="code-tag">&lt;plugin&gt;</SPAN>
            <SPAN class="code-tag">&lt;groupId&gt;</SPAN>org.apache.cayenne.plugins<SPAN class="code-tag">&lt;/groupId&gt;</SPAN>
      	    <SPAN class="code-tag">&lt;artifactId&gt;</SPAN>maven-cayenne-modeler-plugin<SPAN class="code-tag">&lt;/artifactId&gt;</SPAN>
        <SPAN class="code-tag">&lt;/plugin&gt;</SPAN>
    <SPAN class="code-tag">&lt;/plugins&gt;</SPAN>
<SPAN class="code-tag">&lt;/build&gt;</SPAN>
</PRE>
</DIV></DIV>
