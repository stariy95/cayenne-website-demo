<P>Most performance problems in database applications, including those using ORM, are related to the inefficient queries and/or large volumes of data in the database. Here is a few common issues that a typical application may run into:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Converting a large ResultSet into objects takes very long time.</LI>
	<LI>Storing objects from a large ResultSet takes large amounts of memory. Application may eventually run out of memory and crash.</LI>
	<LI>Given a list of objects, there may be a need to retrieve a list of related objects. Often this is done in a suboptimal way, by issuing a single query for each dependent object.</LI>
</UL>


<P>There is no single solution to all performance problems. Cayenne offers a few strategies to improve performance. They should be applied where appropriate.</P>
