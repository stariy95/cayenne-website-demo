	<P>This tutorial starts where the <A href="tutorial.html" title="Tutorial">Cayenne Tutorial</A> left off. If you have gone through the previous tutorial, and have the &quot;tutorial&quot; project open in Eclipse, you can go directly to the <A href="remote-object-persistence-tutorial-client-project.html" title="Remote Object Persistence Tutorial Client Project">next step</A>. If not, here are the compressed instructions to prepare you for work with ROP:</P>
