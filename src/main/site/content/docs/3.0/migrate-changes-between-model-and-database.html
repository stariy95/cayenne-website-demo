	<H3><A name="MigrateChangesbetweenModelandDatabase-IntroductiontoMerging"></A>Introduction to Merging</H3>

<P>After working some time with the model and/or the database, it can be a lot of work to make sure they are in sync. E.g. A table has been added/removed, a varchar column has a different max length and so on. The merge functionality in the modeler handle all of this.</P>

<P>Open the model in the modeler and select the DataMap.</P>

<P><SPAN class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="/docs/3.0/images/merge-detected-changes.png" style="border: 0px solid black"></SPAN></P>

<P>Select tokens and their direction. &quot;To Model&quot; mean that the change is to be made from the database to the model. &quot;To DB&quot; mean that opposite.</P>

<P><SPAN class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="/docs/3.0/images/merge-select-tokens.png" style="border: 0px solid black"></SPAN></P>

<P>It is also possible to see the generated SQL for the selected &quot;To DB&quot; tokens.</P>
