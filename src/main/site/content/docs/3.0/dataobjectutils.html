	<P>DataObjectUtils class provides an important and easy to use facility to obtain a primary key value from a DataObject and to locate a DataObject in the database for a known primary key. Both operations work in a generic fashion and do not require primary key to be an object property.</P>

<DIV class="panelMacro"><TABLE class="warningMacro"><COLGROUP><COL width="24"><COL></COLGROUP><TR><TD valign="top"><img src="/docs/3.0/images/forbidden.gif" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"></TD><TD><B>Security Warning</B><BR>DataObjectUtils make it very easy to use a primary key value as a universal &quot;code&quot; for an object in web forms and URLs. This opens a potential security hole in the interface. If application code is not careful enough, a malicious user can gain access to the information she is not allowed to see (e.g. other people's accounts) simply by trying a series of sequential numbers. So, for example, it is probably okay to use product PK to build a bookmarkable link to a catalog product, but it may not be appropriate to do that for a private user profile record.</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<P>DataObjectUtils API is really straightforward and self-explanatory. It supports the most common case of a single column integer primary key, but also a more generic case of an arbitrary PK (that can also be compound, i.e. consist of more than one column). Here is an example:</P>

<DIV class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><DIV class="codeContent panelContent">
<PRE class="code-java">
<SPAN class="code-comment">// obtain PK to build a bookmarkable artist page URL
</SPAN>Artist artist = ...;
<SPAN class="code-object">int</SPAN> artistID = DataObjectUtils.intPKForObject(artist);
<SPAN class="code-object">String</SPAN> artistURL = <SPAN class="code-quote">&quot;http:<SPAN class="code-comment">//www.example.org/catalogapp/artists?a=&quot;</SPAN> + artistID;</SPAN>
</PRE>
</DIV></DIV>

<DIV class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><DIV class="codeContent panelContent">
<PRE class="code-java">
<SPAN class="code-comment">// find an artist from URL parameters
</SPAN>HttpServletRequest request = ...;
DataContext context = ...;
<SPAN class="code-object">String</SPAN> idString = request.getParameter(<SPAN class="code-quote">&quot;a&quot;</SPAN>);

<SPAN class="code-keyword">if</SPAN>(idString != <SPAN class="code-keyword">null</SPAN>) {
  Artist artist = DataObjectUtils.objectForPK(context, Artist.class, <SPAN class="code-object">Integer</SPAN>.parseInt(idString));
}
</PRE>
</DIV></DIV>
