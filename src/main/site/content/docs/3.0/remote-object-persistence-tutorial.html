<P>This tutorial is an extension of the <A href="tutorial.html" title="Tutorial">Cayenne tutorial</A>, and shows how to deploy an existing mapping project as a Cayenne web service, and then write a command-line client to access the service. Note that in most real applications the client will be a GUI application (Swing, SWT, etc). We are showing the command-line example to avoid dealing with UI details and concentrate on Cayenne API. Just like the Cayenne tutorial, this one uses Maven, Eclipse and Derby. Full tutorial source code in a form of Eclipse project is distributed with Cayenne (see <TT>&quot;tutorials/tutorial-rop-server&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;tutorials/tutorial-rop-client&quot;</TT> folders).</P>
