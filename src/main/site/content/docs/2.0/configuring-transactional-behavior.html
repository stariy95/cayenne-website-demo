<P>Each DataDomain can be configured to explicitly commit/rollback its transactions or to rely on deployment container to do that. This is done by checking or unchecking &quot;Container-Managed Transactions&quot; checkbox. </P>

<P>By default &quot;Container-Managed Transactions&quot; is unchecked, letting Cayenne to handle its transactions. Check this checkbox when using Cayenne under container-managed transactions control, i.e. within EJB environment.</P>
