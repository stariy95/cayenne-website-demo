<P>Now that we've got a feel of how <A href="tutorial-datacontext.html" title="Tutorial DataContext">DataContext works</A> and how to <A href="tutorial-dataobjects.html" title="Tutorial DataObjects">create and save objects</A>, let's take a small diversion and implement a piece of code that will delete all data from the database every time the tutorial application is started. We'll learn how to map a raw SQL query with parameters using the modeler and then execute it in the code.</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Open CayenneModeler, go to <TT>&quot;File &gt; Recent Files&quot;</TT> and choose the tutorial mapping file.</LI>
	<LI>When the project opens, select the DataMap, and click on &quot;Create Query&quot; button (or select &quot;<TT>Project &gt; Create Query</TT>&quot; from the menu).</LI>
	<LI>For the query type select &quot;Raw SQL&quot; and click &quot;Create&quot;.</LI>
	<LI>For &quot;Query Name&quot; enter &quot;DeleteAll&quot; - this will be the key used to reference query later in the code:</LI>
</UL>


<P><SPAN class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="/docs/2.0/images/sql-template.jpg" style="border: 0px solid black"></SPAN></P>

<P>Ignore &quot;Select Properties&quot; settings as the query will not select anything. Rather it will delete all rows from the table with name specified as a parameter.  </P>

<UL>
	<LI>Go to &quot;SQL Scripts&quot; tab and enter the following in the right panel:</LI>
</UL>


<DIV class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><DIV class="preformattedContent panelContent">
<PRE>delete from $table</PRE>
</DIV></DIV>

<P>Note that &quot;$table&quot; is a variable that will be dynamically substituted by Cayenne in runtime with the table name. (Detailed discussion of SQLTemplate scripting options is provided <A href="scripting-sqltemplate.html" title="Scripting SQLTemplate">here</A>).</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Query mapping is complete. Save the project in the Modeler and go back to Eclipse.</LI>
	<LI>In Eclipse, refresh the mapping by right-clicking on cayenne-tutorial project and selecting &quot;Refresh&quot;.</LI>
	<LI>Now add the following code inserting it after the DataContext creation line and before any other code:</LI>
</UL>


<DIV class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><DIV class="codeHeader panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><B>Main.java</B></DIV><DIV class="codeContent panelContent">
<PRE class="code-java">QueryChain chain = <SPAN class="code-keyword">new</SPAN> QueryChain();
chain.addQuery(<SPAN class="code-keyword">new</SPAN> NamedQuery(<SPAN class="code-quote">&quot;DeleteAll&quot;</SPAN>, Collections.singletonMap(
                <SPAN class="code-quote">&quot;table&quot;</SPAN>,
                <SPAN class="code-quote">&quot;PAINTING&quot;</SPAN>)));
chain.addQuery(<SPAN class="code-keyword">new</SPAN> NamedQuery(<SPAN class="code-quote">&quot;DeleteAll&quot;</SPAN>, Collections.singletonMap(
                <SPAN class="code-quote">&quot;table&quot;</SPAN>,
                <SPAN class="code-quote">&quot;ARTIST&quot;</SPAN>)));
chain.addQuery(<SPAN class="code-keyword">new</SPAN> NamedQuery(<SPAN class="code-quote">&quot;DeleteAll&quot;</SPAN>, Collections.singletonMap(
                <SPAN class="code-quote">&quot;table&quot;</SPAN>,
                <SPAN class="code-quote">&quot;GALLERY&quot;</SPAN>)));

context.performGenericQuery(chain);</PRE>
</DIV></DIV>

<P>Note that since we need to run the same query three times with different sets of parameters, first we created a <TT><A href="querychain.html" title="QueryChain">QueryChain</A></TT> that can hold other queries. Then we added three <TT><A href="namedquery.html" title="NamedQuery">NamedQueries</A></TT> (the order is important - painting has to be deleted before artist or gallery due to the foreign key constraints). NamedQuery is a query that is a reference to another query mapped via CayenneModeler (in this case - a query called &quot;DeleteAll&quot; that we mapped above).</P>

<P>Now we can re-run the application and see the following output in the beginning of the log:</P>

<DIV class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><DIV class="preformattedContent panelContent">
<PRE>INFO  QueryLogger: delete from PAINTING
INFO  QueryLogger: === updated 2 rows.
INFO  QueryLogger: delete from ARTIST
INFO  QueryLogger: === updated 1 row.
INFO  QueryLogger: delete from GALLERY
INFO  QueryLogger: === updated 1 row.</PRE>
</DIV></DIV>

<P>Note that raw sql queries above (aka <A href="sqltemplate-query.html" title="SQLTemplate Query">SQLTemplates</A>) are run directly against the database bypassing Cayenne object layer. If instead of bulk delete you needed to delete individual objects, you should do so using <TT>DataContext.deleteObject(..)</TT> as discussed <A href="tutorial-delete.html" title="Tutorial Delete">here</A>.</P>
