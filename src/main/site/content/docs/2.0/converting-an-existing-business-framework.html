<P>If there is an existing data layer (e.g. DAO) that needs to be converted to Cayenne, currently most of the mapping tasks will have to be done manually using the Modeler.</P>

<DIV class="panelMacro"><TABLE class="noteMacro"><COLGROUP><COL width="24"><COL></COLGROUP><TR><TD valign="top"><img src="/docs/2.0/images/warning.gif" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"></TD><TD><B>Note for EOF Users</B><BR>CayenneModeler provides import function for the EOModels. So most of the mapping conversions should be automatic.</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<P>In any case there is a good chance of reusing business methods already defined in a persistence framework. And definitely any existing database can be used as is. One possible approach to conversion is to follow these steps:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Reverse engineer the database schema into a new Cayenne mapping project.</LI>
	<LI>Update class names and packages match the names of the existing classes.</LI>
	<LI>Run class generation using &quot;generation gap&quot; pattern (to create subclass/superclass pair for each entity). This would only create superclasses with set/get methods for persistent properties, without touching the existing classes.</LI>
	<LI>Modify existing DAO classes to change the superclass to a corresponding generated one (e.g. &quot;Employee extends _Employee&quot;).</LI>
	<LI>Remove any persistent properties with their setters and getters from the subclass.</LI>
	<LI>Remove all the DAO-specific persistence code.</LI>
	<LI>Rewrite any other &quot;business&quot; methods to use DataContext for data operations.</LI>
</UL>
