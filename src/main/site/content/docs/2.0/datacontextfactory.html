<P>To customize how the DataContext is built, an <EM>optional</EM> DataContextFactory can be registered with DataDomain in the Modeler. The class name you enter must implement <TT>org.apache.cayenne.access.DataContextFactory</TT> interface. If a factory is entered, Cayenne will use it in <A href="obtaining-datacontext.html" title="Obtaining DataContext">all places</A> where the DataContext is created. A single factory instance is reused for the life of the DataDomain.</P>
