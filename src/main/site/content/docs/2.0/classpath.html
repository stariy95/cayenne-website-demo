<P>ClassPath Preferences panel allows users to add or remove locations of the external class libraries (JAR, ZIP, or class directories). These external libraries will be used by CayenneModeler to load JDBC drivers, custom DB adapters, or any other Java resources that are not a part of the Modeler distribution itself.</P>
