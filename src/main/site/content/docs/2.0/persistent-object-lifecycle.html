<P>A lifecycle of a persistent object can be represented as a number of states and transitions between them. These states are formally defined as &quot;int&quot; constants in <TT>org.apache.cayenne.PersistenceState</TT> class. Transitions between states (see the diagram below) occur in response to the application interacting with either persistent objects or Cayenne context. Whenever a transition occurs, Cayenne automatically updates &quot;persistenceState&quot; property of all affected objects by calling <TT>setPersistenceState()</TT>.</P>
