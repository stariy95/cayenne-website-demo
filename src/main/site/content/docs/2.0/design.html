	<P>This chapter discusses the architecture of the core Cayenne framework. It only deals with the runtime operation of the object-relational persistence layer. <A href="modeler-guide.html" title="Modeler Guide">Mapping procedures</A> and <A href="remote-object-persistence-guide.html" title="Remote Object Persistence Guide">remote object persistence</A> are discussed elsewhere. The information below is not strictly required to start using Cayenne, so new users can skip it initially and come back later to gain better understanding of how Cayenne operates under the hood.</P>
