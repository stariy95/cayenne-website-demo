	<P>Cayenne defines a simple yet powerful object-based expression language. Cayenne expressions are database independent and are used as query qualifiers and orderings and also to perform in-memory evaluation with DataObjects (and generally any kind of Java Beans). BNF of Cayenne expression language is described <A href="bnf-for-expressionparser.html" title="BNF for ExpressionParser">here</A>.</P>

<P>Expressions are broadly divided into the following categories: object property expressions (also called &quot;path expressions&quot;), arithmetic operations, and conditional expressions. Cayenne contains a parser to build expressions from strings, and also features explicit expression API. Various ways of creating and using expressions are described later in this chapter. </P>
