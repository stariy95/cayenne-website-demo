<P>Cayenne stores mapping and deployment information using a set of XML files with a predefined format. These files can be always edited by hand, but Cayenne goes beyond that. A standard distribution contains CayenneModeler - a Java Swing GUI application that serves as an Object/Relational modeling tool. It is much more than just a specialized XML editor. It provides a comprehensive set of O/R functions, including:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Work with Cayenne mapping projects.</LI>
	<LI>Reverse-engineering RDBMS schema into Cayenne DataMaps.</LI>
	<LI>Generation of the database schema from the mapping information stored in DataMaps.</LI>
	<LI>Java class generation from the mapping information stored in DataMaps.</LI>
	<LI>Management of the project deployment structure and database connection information.</LI>
	<LI>Validation of created mappings.</LI>
	<LI>Import from some other O/R model formats (EOF).</LI>
</UL>


<P>Among other things CayenneModeler allows new users to learn the concepts used in Cayenne framework, its terminology, and the overall structure.</P>

<P>The following chapters of this Guide discuss how to use various functions of CayenneModeler.</P>
