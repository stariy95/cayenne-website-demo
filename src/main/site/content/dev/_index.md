This is the most up-to-date document explaining internal Cayenne
development procedures, e.g. how to obtain the latest source code, compile
it, run unit tests, etc. "Developers" in this context are people who
contribute code to Cayenne. If you downloaded Cayenne to use it in a Java
application and do not intend to submit patches or extension, this
information is probably of no use to you. Consult Cayenne user docs instead.
