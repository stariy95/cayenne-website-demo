* Get code from Git and [build it from command line](building-cayenne.html)
 to seed the local repository.
* Create a workspace outside of the main checkout folder.
* Install [Maven2 Eclipse plugin](http://www.sonatype.org/m2eclipse/)
* Install any other plugins that you would normally use. 
* Go to "File > Import ... > Existing Maven Projects", and import the projects that you want.
