## Git Repository

Cayenne uses Git for source code version control. "Master" writable repository is located here:

[https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cayenne.git](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cayenne.git)

It can be cloned by anyone, and that's where committers would ultimately push the code. We also have a GitHub read-only copy:

[https://github.com/apache/cayenne](https://github.com/apache/cayenne) 

Feel free to fork and/or star Cayenne there.


## Legacy Subversion Repository

Up to version 3.2M2 we used Subversion. For archival purposes SVN repository is still available 
in a read-only mode:

[https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/cayenne/main/](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/cayenne/main/)

Note that it contains branches and tags for releases prior to 3.0, that are not present in Git. So if you are looking for those older releases, you will have to use SVN.
