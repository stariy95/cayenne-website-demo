There are several levels of access to the Cayenne project and source.

1. Documentation only access. Access to the Confluence system for creating
documentation means that these users are able to edit and create content
which then available on this web site and bundled with the download.
1. Committers have direct access to Git and are able to make changes to the
entire source repository.
1. Project Management Committee (PMC) members have further responsibility
for the project as a whole and for ensuring that releases meet all the
appropriate standards.
1. PMC Chair. This person has a leadership role in the project and has a
special responsibility to the Apache board.

For further details consult the official [Apache handbook](http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#roles)
.

In addition to the general Apache responsibilities, this is what is
expected of everyone with privileges within the Cayenne project.

## Contribution
Contribution to the project can take many forms. Updating documentation and
helping users on the mailing lists are just as important as writing code.
Everyone here is a volunteer, so quantity of effort is not the most
important factor. Help when you can, but let the rest of the community know
if you will be out of action for an extended period.

## Mailing lists
Cayenne takes special pride in the support we give to users of the
software. That means being helpful to end users where you have the time and
the answers. Just as importantly, users look to the committers and PMC
members to set the tone of the mailing lists; keeping them friendly and
pleasant places to be for all users regardless of their English language
skills or technical experience. When things might go off the rails, a
gentle nudge back in the right direction is all that is needed.

## Voting
Each release should be voted on by the committers and PMC members. Even
though committer votes cannot count officially by Apache rules, they will
be given serious consideration by the PMC members. Further voting details
are in the release pages of this site.
